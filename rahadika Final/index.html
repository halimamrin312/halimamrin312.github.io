                        automotive manufacturer Mercedes-Benz and British automobile manufacturer McLaren Automotive and
                        sold from 2003 to 2010. When the car was developed, Mercedes-Benz owned 40 per cent of the
                        McLaren Group and the car was produced in conjunction between the two companies. SLR is an
                        abbreviation for "Sport Leicht Rennsport" (Sport Light Racing), a homage to the Mercedes-Benz
                        300 SLR which served as the car's inspiration.[5] The car was offered in coup√©, roadster and
                        speedster bodystyles with the latter being a limited edition model</p>
